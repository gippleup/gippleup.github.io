<p>My Journey to programming started when I started making emoticon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a thing that I was tempted to, but I refrained to do so, for long time. How long? Like, two-weeks?</p>
<p>It was summer, 2017, maybe late May, I took time off from school. At that time, I was too tired learning stuffs that I barely wanted to learn. I wanted something that can inspire me, something that I can immerse myself in.</p>
<p>At that time, emoticon was hot. I mean, really hot, at least in Korea. Many success stories about emoticon was spread and I wanted to be part of the story, though I didn&rsquo;t admit.</p>
<p>I asked myself.</p>

</span><span class="c1">//I&#39;m actually quite good at drawing.
</span><span class="c1">//I think I can do that.

</span><span class="c1">//You alreay know that?
</span><span class="c1"></span><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">q3</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sb">`Would it be okay to do this?`</span>
<span class="c1">//Yeap, sure.
</span><span class="c1">//I think it&#39;ll be fun!
</span><span class="c1">//You need something fun, right?
</span><span class="c1"></span><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">q4</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sb">`Fuck it! Try it!`</span>
<span class="c1">//Yeah!!!!
</span><span class="c1">//Turn the computer on!!!
</span></code></pre></div><p>And I started making emoticon.
Below is one of my emoticons which made at that time.
(Actually many of the first works has been evaporated as the platform has changed their business model, RIP, amen.)</p>
<div style="text-align: center; overflow-x: auto">
<blockquote>
<p><strong class="orange">Month 1: &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s super fun!&ldquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
  <blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/nC6l405"><a href="//imgur.com/a/nC6l405"></a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p style="text-align: left">
  ⬆️ This was a thing. With this sticker pack, I could earn some pocket money and confidence. And this, was a thing that I reminded time to time when I wanted to give up making emoticon.
  </p><br>
  <p style="text-align: left">
  Afterwards, I made about 10 or more emoticon packs in a row, which were all failure.
  </p><br>
<blockquote>
<p><strong class="orange">Month 2: &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I try this sooner?!&ldquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
  <blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/jSYCLwp"><a href="//imgur.com/a/jSYCLwp">White Seal, Nora</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <p style="text-align: left">
  It was really fun. I was fascinated how an animation can be made with a program. I learnt after effects for making animatons, and I could learn several tools - like joystick n slider, duik, element3D, etc - which were super fun to learn.
  </p><br>
  <p style="text-align: left">
  To look back, I was fascinated by a program. I thought, 'even this boring and loose process can be super efficient with a program.' I could see that I'm learning something and getting better and better. It was fuel for me.
  </p><br>
<blockquote>
<p><strong class="orange">Month 3: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good at AFTER EFFECT!!!&ldquo;</strong></p>

  <p style="text-align: left">
  I made more.

<p><strong class="orange">Month 5: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good at AFTER EFFECT!!!&ldquo;</strong></p>

  <p style="text-align: left">
  And more.
  </p><br>

<p><strong class="orange">Month 8: &ldquo;Hmm, it&rsquo;s a bit tiring,</strong><br>
<strong class="orange">and wtf with downloads???&ldquo;</strong></p>

  <p style="text-align: left">
  And more.
  </p><br>
  <p style="text-align: left">
  And Boom. I was tired doing these stuffs. What made me tired were three things.

</span><span class="c1">//it became super boring.

  <p style="text-align: left">
  At this point, I decided to quit making emoticons.

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, it was a bit <strong class="orange">wasteful.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="but">But</h1>
<p>It was my first attempt to break the boundary that I set to myself. Before doing this, I usually told myself,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Endure it, then you will rejoice the fruit! HAHA!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>FXXX! I rather want to die than doing this!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired&hellip; I want to rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cheer up! Others also endure this, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was on edge.</p>
<p>But after trying something totally new to myself, I started wanting more challenges that I can enjoy, so <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/projects/crasher444/"target="_blank">I started making games</a>.</p>
